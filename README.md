- 👋 Hi, I’m Dachun, a Ph.D. candidate at UIUC.
- 👀 I’m interested in Social Network Analysis (SNA), and I'm using Graph Neural Networks, Large Language Models, Agents, and various ML techniques to facilitate multi-modal SNA, particularly in the area of belief/ideology extraction and polarization detection.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on GNN and LLM works.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
